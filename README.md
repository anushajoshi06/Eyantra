Task 1.2 - Problem Statement

In this task you have to program the robot that can scan the color of the Nuts, pick it from PICK- UP ZONE and place it in the correct DEPOSIT ZONES. The DEPOSIT ZONES are at different
locations on the arena marked as D1 and D2 in Figure 1. 
 Arena for the problem statement is given in Task folder - Task_1.2.ttt file. 
 It is made up of circular, curved and straight paths with a START position. You can
Refer to Figure 1.
 Nuts are of two types - Red colored and Green colored Nuts, at start of run they will be
randomly placed in PICK-UP ZONE. There will be two nuts of each color.
 Upto three Obstacles will be randomly placed on the arena as shown in Figure 2. The
robot has to avoid these obstacles and follow the optimal path. You can use any path- planning algorithms to do so.
 You have to program a robot which will start from START position, follows the line, picks the Nuts and deposits them at DEPOSIT ZONES as per the configuration Table 1.
 After completion of task, robot has to return to START position to signify end of run. 
 Points awarded will depend upon the total time required to finish the run.
 Points will be deducted for any collisions or incorrect placements.
 Team can change the Nuts, Obstacles and DEPOSIT ZONES position to check the code. Table 1: Nuts Deposit Zone
DEPOSIT ZONE              COLOR                CAPACITY
D1                         RED                     2
D2                         GREEN                   2
